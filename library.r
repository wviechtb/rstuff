# An 'improved' library() function that, if necessary, first installs a
# package before trying to load it. It can also take multiple package names
# at once (and requires no quotes), that is, your code could start with:
#
# library(pkg1, pkg2, pkg3).
#
# and all packages will be installed (if necessary) and then loaded.
#
# If you put this into your .Rprofile file, library(pkg) will call this
# function instead of base::library(pkg). You can still use base::library(pkg)
# if you want to make use of the 'base' package library() function.
#
# Note that if you share code with others that makes use of this function,
# you should stick to:
#
# library(pkg1)
# library(pkg2)
# library(pkg3)
# ...
#
# at the beginning of your code so it remains runnable for those who do not
# have this function (of course, they would have to manually install the
# packages first if they are not already installed).
#
# The following line creates an environment into which we will store the
# library() function. By prefixing the environment with a dot, it is not
# directly visible with ls() and hence running rm(list=ls()) to clear your
# workspace will not delete this environment (and hence not the function).
